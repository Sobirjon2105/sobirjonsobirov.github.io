          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            I was born and raised untill the age of 15 in Samarkand, Uzbekistan.
            Growing up, my early years, was fun and boring at the same time
            since there wasn't a lot of technology related fun resources
            involved. It was mostly playing outside with friends until I
            immigrated to United States in 2016 where I had the most fun part of
            my life. It was a struggle just to adapt to the environment, people,
            and of course to the resources that you haven't seen. I continued my
            education in U.S. where I finished my high school just in time and
            was able to get into college. If you want to know more about me, go
            to my

            everyday life.

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>
            I pursued my education with a focus on Computer Science. Here is a
            summary of my academic journey:
          </p>
          <h3>Computer Science, Brooklyn College, 2024</h3>
          <p>
            During my 4 years at Brooklyn College, I delved into Web Development
            courses where I had the best professors. The curriculum provided a
            solid foundation web development courses, data structures &
            algorithms, and I had the opportunity to collaborate with peers on
            creating a website, making a full playable pokemon game from
            scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the highlights of my academoc experience was getting a dean's
            list award and participating in computer science club. This
            experience not only enhanced my skills but also fueled my passion
            for computer science.

          <h2>Future as a Software Engineer</h2>
          <p>
            As I look forward to the future, my journey as a software engineer
            is driven by a passion for frontend development and currenly
            learning/mastering the backend to become fullstack engineer to see
            the both sides. Here are some of my goals and aspirations:
          </p>
          <h3>Continuous Learning and Skill Development</h3>
          <p>
            I am committed to staying at the forefront of technological
            advancements in programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            Java, Spring, React, and others. Continuous learning is not just a
            goal but a fundamental aspect of my approach to software
            engineering. I aim to explore emerging technologies, participate in
            relevant courses, and engage in hands-on projects that challenge and
            expand my skill set.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to contribute to impactful projects that address
            real-world challenges. Whether it's developing software solutions
            for tech industries or contributing to open-source projects, I am
            driven by the desire to make a positive difference through
            technology.
          </p>
          <h3>Building a Collaborative and Inclusive Community</h3>
          <p>
            I believe in the power of collaboration and the importance of
            fostering an inclusive community within the tech industry. As I
            progress in my career, I aspire to mentor and support others, share
            knowledge, and actively contribute to creating an environment where
            diverse voices are heard and valued.
          </p>
          <h3>Entrepreneurial Ventures</h3>
          <p>
            In the future, I see myself exploring entrepreneurial opportunities,
            leveraging my software engineering skills to bring innovative
            solutions to market. I am excited about the prospect of founding or
            contributing to startups that align with my values and vision for
            positive change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, my journey as a software engineer is not just about writing
            code; it's about making a meaningful impact, fostering innovation,
            and continuously evolving in a dynamic and ever-changing industry.
